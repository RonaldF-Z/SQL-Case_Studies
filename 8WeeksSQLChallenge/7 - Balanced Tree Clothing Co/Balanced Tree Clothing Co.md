- ##### Case study's data and questions were extracted from this link: [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-7/). 
- ##### All questions were solved using MSSQL Server

## <p align="center">Introduction
Balanced Tree Clothing Company prides themselves on providing an optimised range of clothing and lifestyle wear for the modern adventurer!
Danny, the CEO of this trendy fashion company has asked you to assist the team’s merchandising teams analyse their sales performance and generate a basic financial report to share with the wider business.

## <p align="center">Questions
The following questions can be considered key business questions and metrics that the Balanced Tree team requires for their monthly reports.
Each question can be answered using a single query - but as you are writing the SQL to solve each individual problem, keep in mind how you would generate all of these metrics in a single SQL script which the Balanced Tree team can run each month.

### <p align="center">A. High Level Sales Analysis
#### 1.What was the total quantity sold for all products?
```sql
select sum(qty) total_sold from sales
```
#### 2.What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?
```sql
select sum(qty*price) total_sold from sales
```
#### 3.What was the total discount amount for all products?
```sql
select sum(qty*price - discount) total_sold_with_dsct from sales
```

                                  inner join product_details p1 on s1.prod_id=p1.product_id
                                  where p1.segment_id=p.segment_id

              when p2<=p1 and p2<=p3 then p2
              else p3 end p1,
         case when (p1<=p2 and p1>p3) or (p1>p2 and p1<=p3) then p1
              when (p2<=p1 and p2>p3) or (p2>p1 and p2<=p3) then p2
              else p3 end p2,
         case when p1>=p2 and p1>=p3 then p1
              when p2>=p1 and p2>=p3 then p2
              else p3 end p3,
         nro_combinations
  from nro_combinations
)
select *,dense_rank() over(order by nro_combinations desc) d_rnk from all_combinations

SELECT t1.prod_id, t2.prod_id, t3.prod_id, COUNT(*) AS combination_cnt FROM sales t1
JOIN sales t2 ON t1.txn_id = t2.txn_id AND t1.prod_id < t2.prod_id
JOIN sales t3 ON t1.txn_id = t3.txn_id AND t2.prod_id < t3.prod_id
GROUP BY t1.prod_id, t2.prod_id, t3.prod_id
ORDER BY 4 DESC
```
### <p align="center">E. Bonus Challenge
Use a single SQL query to transform the product_hierarchy and product_prices datasets to the product_details table.
Hint: you may want to consider using a recursive CTE to solve this problem!
```sql
with cte as (
  select id as parent_id,level_text parent_level_text,id,0 as lvl,level_text from product_hierarchy
  where parent_id is null
  union all
  select h.parent_id as parent_id,cte.parent_level_text,h.id,lvl+1 as lvl,h.level_text from cte
  inner join product_hierarchy h on cte.id=h.parent_id
)
select p.product_id,p.price,c2.level_text+' '+c1.level_text+' - '+c1.parent_level_text product_name,
  c1.parent_id category_id,c2.parent_id segment_id,c2.id style_id,
  c1.parent_level_text category_name,c1.level_text segment_name,c2.level_text style_name
from cte c1
inner join cte c2 on c1.id=c2.parent_id
inner join product_prices p on c2.id=p.id
where c1.lvl>0 and c2.lvl>0
order by style_id
```
Easier solution without recursive CTE:
```sql
select p.product_id,p.price,h1.level_text+' '+h2.level_text+' - '+h3.level_text product_name,
  h3.id category_id,h2.id segment_id,h1.id style_id,
  h3.level_text category_name,h2.level_text segment_name,h1.level_text style_name 
from product_prices p
inner join product_hierarchy h1 on p.id=h1.id
inner join product_hierarchy h2 on h1.parent_id=h2.id
inner join product_hierarchy h3 on h2.parent_id=h3.id
```
